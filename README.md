# test-flatmap

A repository to store test flatmaps

This is a simple flatmap for testing purposes. Included here are the connectivity in the `keast-5` which includes organs such as `the spinal cord segment` where `lamina VII of gray matter of spinal` is located. Then, because neuronConnectivity is set to `keast-bladder`, additional parts of `keast-4`, `keast-9`, `keast-10`, and `keast-20` appear.
